Utilizing Advection-diffusion method for the to model flood propogation. This method is used because of the complexity of the system. With so many variable and need to show how small changes impact on a larger scale, the advection-diffusion method is good for modeling this. Things like the slope of the river, river shape, friction, velocity, etc.. all impact the what ultimately happens in reality. Advection-diffusion allows us to add on motifiers that we need in order to properly convey changes and see what variables are causing the largest changes. This is important on a larger scale as the model is deal with trying to understand how flood waves propogate in a river.
