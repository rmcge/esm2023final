EQUATIONS
Describe all terms, parameters, boundary conditions and initial conditions
Parameters:
x (length of channel, m) = 50m
Discretization made in 50 intervals of 1m each
B (width of channel, m) = 50m
t (time, s) = 15 hours
Divided into 360 intervals of 150 seconds each
A (cross section area of flow, m2) = 1
y (surface level of water, m) = 
S0 (slope of bottom of channel) = .0002
Sf (slope of energy grade line) =  0
g (acceleration due to gravity, m/s2) = 9.8
Initial conditions:
Q(x,0) = Q0 
Q0 is the steady state flow of the channel
A(x,0) = A0
A0 is the cross section area for the steady state conditions
Boundary conditions:
Q(0,t)=h(t)," for " t>t_b
Q(0,t)=Q_0 (1+a⋅sin⁡(2πt/T))," for " 0<t<t_b
Simplifications were made:
Flow is considered 1D
Distribution of pressure vertically is hydrostatic
Water is incompressible and homogenous
Density is constant through time and space
