EQUATIONS
The fundamental physical processes being explored are the hydraulic and hydrologic behavior in bodies of water, 
specifically, flood wave propagation in natural rivers. 

The Saint Venant’s equations are the basic equations that describe wave propagation in an open channel. While there are also 
2-dimensional versions of these equations, the 1-dimensional Saint Venant’s equations describe flood mechanics and are used to 
build this model. There are two main equations: 
          (∂Q/∂x)+(∂A/∂t) = 0 -------------------------------------(1)

          (∂Q/∂t)+(∂(Q^2/A)/∂x)+gA((∂y/∂x)-S0)+gASf = 0 -----------(2)
Equation 1 is the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of water volume. Equation 2 is the momentum equation, 
which provides the balancing between forces and momentum change rates. In order to calculate Sf, the Manning formulation was used:
          V = (1/n)R^(2/3)*Sf^(1/2) -------------------------------(3)
To create this model, another form of the momentum equation was derived using equations 1, 2, and 3:
          (∂Q/∂t)+α(∂Q/∂x)+β = 0 ----------------------------------(4)
Where,
          α=2(Q/A)+(((gA/B)-(Q^2/A^2))/((Q/A)((5/3)-(4R/3B))) -----(5)
and
          β=gA(Sf-S0) ---------------------------------------------(6)

Describe all terms, parameters, boundary conditions and initial conditions
Parameters:
x (length of channel, m) = 50m
  - Discretization made in 50 intervals of 1m each
B (width of channel, m) = 50m
t (time, s) = 15 hours
  - Divided into 360 intervals of 150 seconds each
A (cross section area of flow, m^2) = 1
y (surface level of water, m) = 
S0 (slope of bottom of channel) = .0002
Sf (slope of energy grade line) =  0
g (acceleration due to gravity, m/s^2) = 9.8
Initial conditions:
Q(x,0) = Q0 
Q0 is the steady state flow of the channel
A(x,0) = A0
A0 is the cross section area for the steady state conditions
Boundary conditions:
Q(0,t)=h(t)," for " t>t_b
Q(0,t)=Q_0 (1+a⋅sin⁡(2πt/T))," for " 0<t<t_b
Simplifications were made:
Flow is considered 1D
Distribution of pressure vertically is hydrostatic
Water is incompressible and homogenous
Density is constant through time and space
