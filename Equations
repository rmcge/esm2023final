EQUATIONS
Describe all terms, parameters, boundary conditions and initial conditions
Parameters:
x (length of channel, m) = 50m
Discretization made in 50 intervals of 1m each
B (width of channel, m) = 50m
t (time, s) = 15 hours
Divided into 360 intervals of 150 seconds each
A (cross section area of flow, m2) = 
y (surface level of water, m) = 
S0 (slope of bottom of channel) = 
Sf (slope of energy grade line) = 
g (acceleration due to gravity, m/s2)
Initial conditions:
Q(x,0) = Q0 
Q0 is the steady state flow of the channel
A(x,0) = A0
A0 is the cross section area for the steady state conditions
Boundary conditions:
Describe any assumptions being made
Simplifications were made:
Flow is considered 1D
Distribution of pressure vertically is hydrostatic
Water is incompressible and homogenous
Density is constant through time and space
