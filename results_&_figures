How do the results compare with any known solutions, or data?
How do the results change with different methods, time steps, grid spacing, or model parameters?
What did the model tell you about the process you were studying?
How could the model be improved in terms of methods used or processes included?

At least 4 figures describing results 
Have all axes labeled
Variables have units
Everything is readable
Colors, lines, contours, etc. are all easy to discern
