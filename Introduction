In the field of hydrology and hydraulics, understanding flow of water in open channels is an important topic. Gaining a better 
understanding of this topic is essential to solving problems related to water resource management. This study was conducted by 
researchers at the Federal University of Cear√° in Brazil, a country with vast water resources. Because of the vast river system 
in Brazil, flooding due to intense precipitation or control structures breaking is a very present issue. Around the world, 
flooding is among the most frequently occurring natural disasters and results in devastating property damage and human 
casualties (Mujumdar, 2001). This paper seeks to build a hydrodynamic model of flood wave propagation in natural rivers 
using the Saint Venant equations. Building predictive models like this can help to prevent future loss of life and property 
damage due to flooding in the future. Being able to estimate floods and the effect of stream channels on floods, aids 
in the design of effective protective structures (Keskin, 1997).

There are two equations that make up the Saint Venant's equations that describe 1-dimensional flow in an open channel, a 
continuity equation and a momentum equation. The equations this model is based on have been modeled previously using various 
different techniques. Common techniques for solving simplifications to the full momentum equation include kinemmatic wave 
routing (Agiralioglu, 1981) and diffusion approximation (Aken and Yen, 1981. However there are concerns about the accuracy of
these models (Keskin, 1997). There have also been several models of the Saint Venant's equations created without any simplification
for cylindrical and and irregular river cross sections (CITATION). The biggest draw back to these models is the large amount of 
effort and computation that must be done.
